# Fill out the get_name() function to return your name as a string! We've written a main() function for you which calls your function to retrieve your name and then prints it in a greeting.

# Here's a sample run of the program where the name we've decided to return is Sophia (the autograder expects the returned name to be Sophia):

# Howdy Sophia ! ðŸ¤ 

def get_name(name):
    greet = f"Howdy! {name} ðŸ˜Ž"
    return greet

usr = input("Enter Your Name: ")
while usr != "":
    func = get_name(usr)
    print(func)
    usr = input("Enter Your Name: ")
