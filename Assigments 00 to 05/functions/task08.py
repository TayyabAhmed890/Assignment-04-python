# Fill out print_multiple(message, repeats), which takes as parameters a string message to print, and an integer repeats number of times to print message. We've written the main() function for you, which prompts the user for a message and a number of repeats.

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in blue):

# Please type a message: Hello! Enter a number of times to repeat your message: 6 Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!

def print_multiple(message,repeats):
    for i in range(repeats): 
        print(message)


usr = input("Enter Message: ")
usr_num = int(input("Enter a number of times to repeat your message: "))

print_multiple(usr,usr_num)
